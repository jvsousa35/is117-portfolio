## Project Overview

This portfolio was strategically designed to position me for Business Analyst and Data Analyst roles in NJ/NY, particularly within sports tech and consulting environments.

The site communicates clear business value within 5 seconds:
- Who I am
- What problems I solve
- Proof of execution
- A direct recruiter-focused call to action

Primary CTA: **Request My Technical Resume**

## Orchestration Log

During development, the AI initially recommended using a React-based stack. I challenged that decision and pivoted to a lightweight HTML/CSS/JavaScript structure to ensure faster GitHub Pages deployment and cleaner execution. This reinforced the importance of strategic stack selection over unnecessary complexity.
