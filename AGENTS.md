The Mandate

Build a recruiter-focused portfolio site designed to generate interviews for Business Analyst and Data Analyst roles in NJ/NY, specifically targeting sports tech and consulting firms.

The objective is immediate clarity. Within 5 seconds of landing on the site, a recruiter must understand:

Who I am

What business value I provide

The proof of execution I have delivered

How to contact me

Primary Call To Action (CTA):
Request My Technical Resume

This site must communicate operational impact, structured thinking, and execution under pressure.

The Tech Stack

HTML5 (semantic structure)

CSS3 (clean, professional styling)

Vanilla JavaScript (lightweight interactivity only)

GitHub Pages deployment via /docs folder

No frameworks (no React, no heavy libraries)

Why This Stack

A lightweight stack ensures:

Professional discipline without unnecessary complexity
